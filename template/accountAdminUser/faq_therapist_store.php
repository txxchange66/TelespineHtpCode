    <td valign="top" style="padding-left:50px;"><p>Its Tx Xchange’s newest solution to help health, wellness, and fitness providers expand the scope of services they offer, participate in the $25B/yr supplement market, and increase revenue. Tx Xchange customers can easily make a turn-key wellness store available to all their patients and clients as part of the Tx Xchange patient portal. With the store integrated into TX Xchange, patients or clients will have a secure, convenient way to do thorough product research, receive guidance, and buy competitively priced professional brands. Every time they login to watch a video, do their exercises, send a secure message, or read something you suggested, they’ll see your branded wellness store and be encouraged to visit it with special offers, such as free shipping.</p></td>

      <p>Tx Xchange users with Account Administrator privileges login, turn on the store, upload a company logo (if they haven’t previously) and choose what brands and products they want to make available to their patients or clients - that’s it. Patients login, make a purchase from the store and the product is shipped to them. The transaction receipt and shipping materials all appear as if they are coming from your business. All inventory, fulfillment, shipping, returns and customer service is provided by Tx Xchange and its partner, PureRXO (<a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/telehealth-software/patient-relationship/prweb4845354.htm" target="_blank" style="color:blue">see press release</a>).</p> </td>

    <td valign="top" style="padding-left:50px;"><p>With the wellness store, you will be able to diversify and grow new revenue streams without having to invest capital, manage more vendors, or expand operations. With no additional overhead, the money you make drops right to your business’ bottom line in the form of high-margin net profit. Additionally, by giving patients the ability to buy supplements from you (vs. GNC, a competitor, etc.), the relationship with your patient is strengthened and they’ll look to you as a more valuable health, wellness, or fitness resource.</p>

A specific list of brands/percentages will be made available in the Account Administration>Premium Services section of Tx Xchange. Providers are seeing average order sizes of about $60 when their patients buy a 30-day supply of supplements. By the 15<sup>th</sup> of every month, a check will be sent to you for your store’s sales from the previous calendar month.</p></td>

     <td valign="top" style="padding-left:50px;"><p>Yes. Think of your store in the Tx Xchange patient portal as second retail location. One that’s highly trafficked by your patients, doesn’t require any investment in inventory, or operational involvement on your part. If you want to carry a different assortment of products in your "two locations", you can. The Tx Xchange solution gives you the ability to choose exactly the brands and products you want to make available in your wellness store.<p></td>

Additionally, mostly all of the products are hypoallergenic, free of gluten, preservatives, and hydrogenated oils.
