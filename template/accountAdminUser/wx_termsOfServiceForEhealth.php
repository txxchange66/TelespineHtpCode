<br />
By turning on, or enabling, Wholemedx's E-Health Service, you acknowledge and adhere to the following terms and conditions: <br />
<ol type="1">
<li>    By turning on, or enabling, the E-Health Service, you will have the ability to create an online health service, give it a description, list key features, and determine what price you want to charge your patients or clients.</li>
<li>    There is no upfront cost for the E-Health Service. Wholemedx keeps 20% of the sales revenue generated by your patients or clients subscribing to your E-Health Service. For example, if you decide to charge \$20.00 for your E-Health Service, Wholemedx keeps \$4.00. There are no credit card fees, no hosting fees, and all billing, reporting, remuneration to you, and support is included.</li>
<li> Remuneration to you for your 85% of the sales revenue will be made by the 5th of every month for the preceding month. A check will be sent to you at the address listed in your in your Wholemedx account.</li>
<li>    There are no contracts with the E-Health Service. You can turn the service on or off at anytime. If you turn the Service off, your patients or clients that have signed up for (i.e. subscribed) the Service, will continue to be charged the price you set, until they decide to unsubscribe from the Service.</li>
<li>    Wholemedx does not require your patients and clients to enter into any contracts in order to use the E-Health Service. Your patients and clients will be signing up for a Service which they can cancel at any time from their personalized portal.</li>
<li>    If one of your patients or clients unsubscribes from the E-Health Service you create, no refunds will be made.   Once they unsubscribe they won't be charged again, <i>but they are responsible for whatever charges have already been incurred for the current billing period</i>. For example, if their billing cycle is on the 18th of every month, and they cancel on the 24th, they still have to pay for the current month, but won't be charged again after that.</li> </ol> </div>
