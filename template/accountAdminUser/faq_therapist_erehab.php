    <td valign="top" style="padding-left:50px;"><p>Tx Xchange’s E-Rehab Service gives you the ability to make money from patients or clients looking to participate in their own care and work with you online. Patients that can’t afford to come in because of co-pays or high-deductibles, reduced benefits, patients you’ve discharged, but still want your guidance, or patients that simply view online access to the Tx Xchange as a value-add, are all well-suited for the E-Rehab Service. As an extension of your clinic or facility, the E-Rehab Service allows you to provide your expertise online and get paid for it.</p></td>

      <p>With the service enabled, E-Rehab gives you the ability to discontinue access to Tx Xchange and your expertise for patients that are no longer coming into your clinic or facility to see you. You can then market the service as a convenient or affordable way to continue to work with you online. Once you give select patients or clients an “E-Rehab” designation in their health record they again have access to Tx Xchange, your guidance, and their personalized plans. With E-Rehab, you make money that would not have been made otherwise and your patients or clients receive professional care they otherwise would not have received.</p> </td>

    <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>
    <td valign="top" style="padding-left:50px;"><p>There are many different ways to market the value of online care to your patients or clients and as such, there are many different ways to charge for your time and access to Tx Xchange. In part, what you should charge depends on how much time you will be spending supporting them online. We suggest you start with a monthly fee of $25 - $50. Given the limited time you will spend actively supporting them during the month (because the software does the “work”), E-Rehab provides you with a highly profitable new revenue stream. </p>

     <td valign="top" style="padding-left:50px;"><p>It really depends on how you market the service levels you will provide online as part of E-Rehab. Just like patients can expect 30, 45, or 60 minute sessions with you in-person, the same expectations need to be set for E-Rehab. In a scenario where you update their plan 2-3 times/month and respond to 3-5 questions/month, you may spend 10-15 minutes.</p></td>

     <td valign="top" style="padding-left:50px;"><p>In software, "Beta" means that there could be a material number of bugs or inconsistencies that will be experienced. <i>We are using the term "Beta" differently for our E-Rehab Service and you will not experience the normal amount of issues associated with "beta software".</i> E-Rehab is in "Beta" because we want to learn more from our customers about how they market E-Rehab, what patients or clients are willing to pay for online care, and how we can enhance the service to make it more valuable to you. One way we are going to make it more valuable in the future is by building in automated e-commerce capabilities once we get enough feedback from our Beta users. With e-commerce, your patients or clients will be able to sign up for E-Rehab through Tx Xchange, their credit card will be billed monthly, and you'll receive an ACH every month from Tx Xchange. While E-Rehab is in "Beta", there will be no charge for using the service, nor any revenue share, as there will be once E-Rehab is released from "Beta".<p></td>
