Questions regarding this Privacy Policy should be directed to the Site Administrator:<br><br><span>By E-mail:</span> <span style="margin-left:30px;">support@txxchange.com</span><br><span>By Fax:</span> <span style="margin-left:47px;">720.306.8256</span><br><span>By Postal Mail:</span> <span style="margin-left:5px;">Tx Xchange, LLC, 7330 Mt. Meeker Rd, Longmont, CO 80503</span> <br><br>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of our Terms of Service. This policy only addresses the data transactions that occur on Tx Xchange owned or leased servers and databases. Other sites (including those that we link to and third party sites or services) may have their own policies, which we do not control, and thus are not addressed by this policy. <br><br><strong>(1) What Information Is Collected.</strong><br>You provide certain personal information to us, including when you: (a) register for an account, (b) register for free newsletters, (c) send email messages, submit forms or send other information to us, and (d) subscribe to receive services. We may collect personal information from you at other points on our site that state that personal information is being collected. We may also receive certain personal information from physical therapists or third party partners. <br><br>In addition, our servers automatically collect information about which pages are viewed within our site, but in these instances, we do not obtain personally identifiable information about you. We use a feature of your browser called a "cookie" to assign a User ID that automatically identifies your computer when you visit the site. Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on our site. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of the site may not work properly if you do. <br><br><strong>(2) What Organization Is Collecting the Information. </strong><br>Tx Xchange, LLC owns and operates the site and is the company that collects personal information on the site. Our contact information is listed above.<br><br><strong>(3) How the Information Is Used and Disclosed to Third Parties.</strong><br>As a general practice, we do not provide your personally identifiable information to third parties. So, for example, we do not sell your email address or your name and personal demographic information to mass marketers. However, on particular pages where we ask for your personally identifiable information, we may explicitly tell you that the data we are collecting on that page will be shared with third parties, in which case those disclosures shall override anything to the contrary in this policy. In some cases, we use your personally identifiable information to provide information to you, such as to send to you requested newsletters or to provide to you requested services.<br><br><strong>(4) Controlling the Collection, Use and Distribution of Your Information.</strong><br>You can control the content of your personal information by following the instructions stated below in Section 5. <br><br>Please note that if you provide any information on your own or directly to parties who provide service to our web site or any other sites you encounter on the Internet (even if these sites are branded with our branding), different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing information to third parties. <br><br><strong>(5) Correcting, Updating and Deleting Personal Information.</strong><br>You can access and update your personal information, including changing your subscriptions to our email newsletters and opting out of receiving email about our services, by logging into your account at www.txxchange.com. Even if you delete or change some personal information in our registration database, it may still be stored on other databases (including those kept for archival purposes). <br><br><strong>(6) Our Security Procedures.</strong><br>We have established and maintain reasonable security procedures to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of your personally identifiable information. These measures include firewalls, password protection, electronic monitoring, and physical security of our servers, Our employees and our sub-contractors follow specific business practices to maintain the integrity and security of your personal information. "Perfect security," however, does not exist on the Internet.<br><br>Although your privacy is very important to us, due to the existing legal regulatory and security environment, we cannot fully ensure that your private communications and other personally identifiable information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Additionally, in the unlikely event we need to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, we can (and you authorize us to do so) disclose any information about you to private entities, law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe is necessary or appropriate. <br><br>We hope this policy clarifies our procedures regarding your personal information. We reserve the right to change this policy at any time, so please re-visit this page as often as you wish.</div></td>
