Now, when your patients log into their portal 3-4x a week, they will see your store and be more apt to buy your supplements or products.</p></td>

      <p>Patients log into their patient portal about 3-4x a week. That’s a lot of exposure and traffic, and very likely, much more than they currently visit your business website or clinic. By exposing them to your store more frequently, you're giving them more opportunities to buy your supplements or products.</p> </td>

    <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>
    <td valign="top" style="padding-left:50px;"><p>Go to your current online store, copy the web address from your browser's address bar, and paste it into the field labeled "Enter Store Address/URL". It's that easy. Once done, an engaging ‘storefront' appears in all your patient's portals. Every time they click on the 'storefront', they will be taken to your online store.</p>
