    <td valign="top" style="padding-left:50px;"><p>It  is a solution to help health, wellness, and fitness providers expand the scope of services they offer, participate in the $25B/yr supplement market, and increase revenue. Customers can easily make a turn-key wellness store available to all their patients and clients as part of the patient portal. With the store integrated into the portal, patients or clients will have a secure, convenient way to do thorough product research, receive guidance, and buy competitively priced professional brands. Every time they login to watch a video, do their exercises, send a secure message, or read something you suggested, they’ll see your branded wellness store and be encouraged to visit it with special offers, such as free shipping.</p></td>

      <p>Users with Account Administrator privileges login, turn on the store, upload a company logo (if they haven’t previously) and choose what brands and products they want to make available to their patients or clients - that’s it. Patients login, make a purchase from the store and the product is shipped to them. The transaction receipt and shipping materials all appear as if they are coming from your business. All inventory, fulfillment, shipping, returns and customer service is provided by Atrium, the parent company of such brands as Seroyal, Pure Encapsulations, and Douglas Laboratories.</p> </td>

    <td valign="top" style="padding-left:50px;"><p>With the store, you will be able to diversify and grow new revenue streams without having to invest capital, manage more vendors, or expand operations. With no additional overhead, the money you make drops right to your business’ bottom line in the form of high-margin net profit. Additionally, by giving patients the ability to buy supplements from you (vs. GNC, a competitor, etc.), the relationship with your patient is strengthened and they’ll look to you as a more valuable health, wellness, or fitness resource.</p>

From that point on, there's virtually nothing for you to do, no overhead, no operating responsibilities, and no inventory to carry. Just use-the telehealth software with your patients, support their participation so they log in frequently, and see your store's revenue grow. <p></td>

     <td valign="top" style="padding-left:50px;"><p>Yes. Think of your store in the patient portal as second retail location. One that’s highly trafficked by your patients, doesn’t require any investment in inventory, or operational involvement on your part. If you want to carry a different assortment of products in your "two locations", you can. The  solution gives you the ability to choose exactly the brands and products you want to make available in your wellness store.<p></td>

They contain no hidden fillers, coatings, artificial colors or other excipients that would disrupt or diminish the bioavailability of the ingredients. Additionally, mostly all of the products are hypoallergenic, free of gluten, preservatives, and hydrogenated oils. They are meant to be sold by health, wellness, and fitness professionals who recognize the importance of purity, potency, and cost-efficacy.<p></td>
