    <td valign="top" style="padding-left:50px;"><p>With the referral marketing service your patients or clients can much more effectively refer a friend, family member, or co-worker to your clinic, studio, of fitness facility and increase new customer volume for your business. While word-of-mouth referrals from existing patients or clients are likely an important source of new customers, most of them never end up on your schedule. Why? Because information about your business is usually forgotten, misplaced, or never looked up. The referral marketing service solves this problem by making sure all the information necessary to schedule an appointment with your business is emailed to the person being referred. Your business' key information won't be easily forgotten or misplaced any longer. The service leverages the idea that the most effective form of marketing is recommendation-based where both parties know each other. Think of the referral marketing service as a significantly better "mousetrap" for word-of-mouth referrals.</p></td>

      <p>If you enable the service, your patients or clients will see a well-designed "call-to-action" button on their homepage (see screen shot below). Every time they login, they'll see the "call-to-action" asking them to refer people they know to your practice or business. When they click on it, a special window opens (see screen shot below) and the patient fills in some basic information about the person they want to refer and writes a personal note. They click "Send" and the personal note along with your business' telephone number, email address, website, mapped address, business overview, and logo are automatically emailed to your potential new patient or client.</p> </td>

The referral marketing service is built on the concept of closed-loop marketing which gives businesses the ability to determine which channels are the most efficient sources of new customers. With the reporting you can see monthly totals, individual contact information for the person being referred, and the referring patient. </p></td>
