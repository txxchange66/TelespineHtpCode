Things to work on:
	fallback for older browsers
	preview functionality
	better getSelected functionality (get the offsets of start and end so we can leave html intact)
	add in an extra iframe layer so loading multiple style sheets can work better

Things to do in this or later versions:
This version:
	look into the html2xhtml script -- it works well, and I think we should use it but it's liscensing is bad so it has to be re-written.

Later versions:
	button feedback -- if on bold text, show the bold button pressed etc.
	advanced toolbar -- switching between design and source views should result in a different toolbar.
	load editable regions into another iframe to allow for specific style sheet use
		-- this means we have to redo how all the iframes are handled .. by going down two levels instead of one (functionize time)
	add specific toolbars (check ms word for examples).  when selecting a table, show additional table toolbar buttons, and when selecting an image, show image toolbar buttons, etc.
	add line spacing button and control
	figure out a better way to do dialog control (so the window stays in front, possibly locking the opening window)
	add spell checking -- ajax would be perfect for this, but we need to get a better 'getSelected' function
	redo toolbar more like ms word for full toolbar mode
